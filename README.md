#Music Album Analysis with SQL

Welcome to my Music Album Analysis project, where I dive into a comprehensive dataset of music albums, tracks, and customer interactions using SQL. This project demonstrates how we can leverage SQL queries to extract valuable insights from music-related data, enabling us to answer specific business and analytical questions. It's designed to showcase my skills in SQL query writing, data analysis, and interpretation, and will be a valuable addition to my GitHub portfolio.

-> Project Overview:

In this project, I analyzed a large dataset related to music albums, artists, tracks, and customer spending. I performed various SQL queries to answer insightful business questions, such as identifying the best-performing artists, analyzing track lengths, and determining customer spending patterns.

-> Key Questions Explored:

-> Rock Music Analysis:
Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset.
This query identifies the top artists who have contributed the most to rock music based on the number of tracks they have written.

-> Track Length Analysis:
Select track names and their lengths in milliseconds, filter tracks longer than the average length, and order the result by song length in descending order.
In this analysis, I examined the track lengths across different albums and filtered out the tracks that exceed the average song length, giving insights into track duration trends.

-> Best Customer Identification:
Who is the best customer?
Here, I wrote a query to find the customer who has spent the most money, which helps businesses identify key revenue-generating customers.

-> Customer Spending on Artists:
Find how much each customer has spent on artists.
This query provides an analysis of total spending per customer, broken down by artist, offering a clear view of customer preferences and artist popularity based on their financial contributions.
